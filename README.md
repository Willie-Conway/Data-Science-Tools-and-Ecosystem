## Arithmetic Expressions in Python 🧮

Here are some examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions:

```python
# Addition ➕
print(3 + 3)  # Output: 6

# Subtraction ➖
print(3 - 3)  # Output: 0

# Multiplication ✖️
print(3 * 3)  # Output: 9

# Division ➗
print(3 / 3)  # Output: 1.0

# Multiply then add
print((3 * 4) + 5)  # Output: 17

# Convert 200 minutes to hours
print(200 / 60)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
